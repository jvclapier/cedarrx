## 💬 Example Conversations

### **Example 1: New Section from Scratch**

**You:**
```
@DESIGN-AGENT.md

I need to build a "Features" section for the homepage
```

**Agent:**
```
Hi! Ready to build the Features section for [BRAND_NAME].

Before I start:

1. Do you have any inspiration sites I should reference?
   Example: "Check out the features section on stripe.com"

2. What's the primary goal?
   (Educate about features? Drive conversions? Build trust?)

3. What mood should it evoke?
   (Clean/informational? Bold/dramatic? Playful/interactive?)

4. Content provided or should I suggest?

5. Background preference?
   (Dark for drama, light for clarity, or let me decide?)
```

**You:**
```
Inspiration: Look at the product showcase on notion.so
Goal: Educate + convert
Mood: Clean and informational
You suggest content
Light background
```

**Agent:**
```
Great! Analyzing Notion's product showcase...

Here are 3 design options for your Features section:

### **Example 2: With Specific Inspiration**

**You:**
```
@DESIGN-AGENT.md

Build a hero section inspired by linear.app's homepage
```

**Agent:**
```
Analyzing Linear's hero...

What I'm noticing:
- Bold, statement-making headline
- Minimal, focused message
- Strong contrast (white on dark)
- Single clear CTA

[BRAND_NAME] translation:
✓ Dark background (dramatic impact)
✓ Our heading + accent font mix
✓ Light text with accent CTA button
✓ Atmospheric photo with overlay
✓ Enhanced with magnetic button + parallax

Here are 3 variations:

### **Example 3: Iterating on Existing**

**You:**
```
@DESIGN-AGENT.md

The pricing section feels too plain. Can we make it more engaging?
```

**Agent:**
```
Let me present 3 ways to enhance the pricing section:

Option 1: Add magnetic hover effects + card lift
Option 2: Interactive comparison slider
Option 3: Animated pricing tiers with stagger reveals

Which approach interests you?
```
