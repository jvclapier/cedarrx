I need to build a "Services" section for the homepage

**Agent:**
```
Hi! Ready to build the Services section for CedarRX.

Before I start:

1. Do you have any inspiration sites I should reference?
   Example: "Check out the services on Cedar Clinic"

2. What's the primary goal?
   (Educate about services? Drive conversions? Build trust?)

3. What mood should it evoke?
   (Clean/informational? Warm/approachable? Professional?)

4. Content provided or should I suggest?

5. Background preference?
   (Warm cream, white, or let me decide?)
```

**You:**
```
Inspiration: Cedar Clinic services grid
Goal: Educate + convert
Mood: Warm and professional
You suggest content
Warm cream with white cards
```

**Agent:**
```

Analyzing Cedar Clinic's hero...

CedarRX translation:

### **Example 3: Iterating on Existing**

**You:**
```
@DESIGN-AGENT.md

The services cards feel too plain. Can we make them more engaging?
```

**Agent:**
```
Let me present 3 ways to enhance the services cards:

Option 1: Add gentle hover lift + shadow increase
Option 2: Add icons with circular backgrounds
Option 3: Add "Learn More" links with arrow animations

Which approach interests you?
```
